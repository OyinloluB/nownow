                <br />
                <br />
                Our website has in place a Consumer Data Platform (CDP). Our
                purpose in using CDP is to ensure that you receive advertisement
                content tailored to your interests in our websites and in
                external sites you visit. A CDP is an advertising technology
                that automatically creates audience segments to share the best
                of our campaigns with you and other beer lovers. Our CDP
                automatically analyses and categorizes data deriving from
                different sources, for example, other sites and other website
                users.
                <br />
                <br /> We will only process your personal data after you provide
                us your consent, following section 2.2 (a) of the NDPR. You will
                not suffer any detriment if you don't consent to this operation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once consent is provided, our CDP will start processing your
                data and it will be shared with other business partners of Arm
                Treasure Data using the same tool. The Data Controller for this
                operation is Company Secretary, so please keep in mind that AB
                InBev/International Breweries Plc has no control over who your
                data is shared with as this is unilaterally determined by the
                CDP. As the technology of a CDP is very complex and various
                stakeholders are involved, in case you would like to know more
                about this operation please review the information provided by
                the Arm Treasure Data for further guidance.
